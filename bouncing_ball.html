    <h2>Paddle Ball</h2>
    <img id = "Hi" src = "paddleball01.png" onclick = "changeImg()">
    <p>This project was made in Scratch. The paddle follows the mouse horizontally. When you start, the goal is to keep the yellow sprite bouncing as much as possible.</p>
    <h2 <img id = "pig_game"> Pig</h2>
    <img src = "pig.png">
    <p>This project was made in Scratch. There are two players, and the use of variables keeps track of the score. As the die is rolled, the number adds up, unless a 1 is rolled. The player to first reach 50 wins. Of course, you can change what the target point by changing a number in the code.</p>
    <h2 <img id = "ball_game"> Bouncing Balls</h2>
    <img src = "bounceBalls.png">
    <p>This project was made using Python. It starts off with a green screen, and when the mouse is clicked somewhere, the message "Here!" gets printed while a flashing ball appears and starts bouncing. There are unlimited number of balls, as long as the screen is clicked.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <img id = "des_" src = "desLandscape.png">
    <p>This project was made using Python turtle. It just drags the pen into a spiral, alternating between two colors to create a design.</p>
